Ripple Prompt — Redesign Client Dashboard (Competitions + Equity + Rank + Top-25 Drilldown)

You are redesigning the Bullfight client dashboard UI/UX (React/Next + Tailwind assumed). Keep the existing dark theme + red accent branding and overall aesthetic, but significantly improve layout, hierarchy, and mobile responsiveness.

Primary UX Goals

Show the user their active competitions in a tabular/list row format that works great on desktop and mobile.

Provide a quick equity curve chart so the user can instantly see performance trends.

Show rank as a dropdown selector (rank across competitions OR per selected competition).

Each competition row has a clear “Enter Arena” CTA on the right side (sticky on desktop; prominent on mobile).

Clicking a competition row expands a dropdown panel showing:

competition details

Top 25 competitors table (rank, username, return %, equity, drawdown, win rate, trades count)

user can click any competitor in Top 25 to open a Competitor Detail drawer/modal showing:

competitor equity chart

tabs: Trades / Deals / Orders / Summary

each tab shows an appropriate table

Information Architecture / Layout
Desktop Layout (primary)

Use a two-column layout:

Left (main, ~65–70%): Active Competitions list/table

Right (sidebar, ~30–35%): “Performance Snapshot” card stack

Right Sidebar (“Performance Snapshot”)

Include:

Card 1: Equity Curve (your account)

time range toggles: 1D / 1W / 1M / All

small KPIs above chart: Balance, Equity, Return %, Drawdown %, Rank (dropdown)

Card 2: Selected Competition Summary (when a competition is selected)

Status badge (OPEN/RUNNING/LIVE)

Your rank, return, equity

“Enter Arena” CTA (also exists in row)

Mobile Layout

Collapse into single column:

Performance Snapshot (equity chart + KPIs)

Active Competitions list

Expanded competition dropdown becomes an accordion.

Competitor details open as a full-screen bottom sheet with tabs.

Active Competitions List (Row + Expand)

Replace the current stacked cards with a responsive table-like list:

Each row shows:

Left: Competition name + type icon + status badge

Middle: Your rank (e.g. #2/254), return %, equity

Right: Enter Arena button (primary)

Row is clickable (except Enter Arena) to expand/collapse dropdown panel.

Row interactions:

Click row → expand dropdown

Expanded dropdown includes:

“Competition Overview” mini section (rules, start/end, prize, participants)

Top 25 competitors table (see below)

Rank Dropdown Behavior

At top of page (or inside sidebar KPI header) add:

“Rank View” dropdown:

“Overall (All Competitions)”

“Selected Competition”
If selected competition view, show rank within that competition.
If overall, show your global leaderboard rank (if exists) or “N/A”.

Top 25 Competitors Table (Expanded Panel)

In expanded dropdown:

Table columns (desktop):

Rank | Trader | Return % | Equity | Max DD % | Win Rate | Trades | Actions

On mobile: show condensed rows:

Rank + Trader on first line

Return% + Equity on second line

Chevron for details

Actions:

Clicking a competitor row opens a Competitor Detail drawer (desktop right-side drawer; mobile bottom sheet)

Competitor Detail Drawer / Modal

When a user clicks a Top 25 competitor:
Show:

Header: Trader name, rank, return, equity, badge

Equity chart (same chart component)

Tabs:

Summary

Trades

Deals

Orders

Tables:

Trades tab: symbol, side, lots, entry, exit, pnl, open time, close time

Deals tab: deal id, symbol, execution price, volume, fee, timestamp

Orders tab: order id, type, status, requested price, filled price, timestamp

Include filter controls:

Symbol filter

Date range filter

PnL sort (desc default)

Visual Design Requirements

Keep Bullfight style:

dark background, subtle gradients, red accents, neon-like badges

rounded cards, soft borders, subtle shadows

Improve typography hierarchy:

clear titles, muted secondary text, consistent spacing

Use badges consistently for status:

OPEN (green), RUNNING (red/orange), LIVE (green pulse)

Make tables feel modern:

sticky headers on desktop

row hover states

zebra/alternate row backgrounds subtle

Ensure accessible contrast and touch targets.

Components to Implement

DashboardPage

PerformanceSnapshot (equity chart + KPIs + rank dropdown)

CompetitionList (table-like list)

CompetitionRow (expandable)

TopCompetitorsTable

CompetitorDrawer (with tabs and chart)

Reusable EquityChart component (sparkline in row optional, full chart in sidebar/drawer)

Data Assumptions / Wiring (use placeholders if needed)

Assume endpoints exist or mock:

GET /api/me/competitions → active competitions + your stats per competition

GET /api/me/equity?range=... → your equity timeseries

GET /api/competitions/:id/top?limit=25 → top 25 leaderboard

GET /api/competitions/:id/competitors/:userId/equity?range=...

GET /api/competitions/:id/competitors/:userId/trades

GET /api/competitions/:id/competitors/:userId/deals

GET /api/competitions/:id/competitors/:userId/orders

If APIs don’t exist, implement a clean mock data layer and structure the code to swap in real endpoints later.

Output

Deliver:

Updated dashboard page UI matching this spec

Fully responsive behavior (desktop + mobile)

Competitor drilldown working with mocked or wired data

Clean components, no placeholder “lorem ipsum”

Keep everything consistent with current brand styling
