Aggregates (Per Second)
Aggregates (Per Second)
WS
Real-Time: wss://socket.massive.com/forex
Stream second-by-second aggregated OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) and volume data for a specified Forex currency pair via WebSocket. These aggregates update continuously in Eastern Time (ET) and are derived from the best bid/offer quotes rather than executed trades. If no new quotes occur within a given minute, no bar is emitted, transparently indicating a period without market updates. By providing a continuous feed of updated market snapshots, this endpoint supports intraday analysis, dynamic charting, and the refinement of real-time Forex trading strategies.

Use Cases: Real-time monitoring, dynamic charting, intraday strategy development, market research.
