You are Replit Agent. The current order ticket / execution UI is broken and looks trash. You must rebuild ONLY the order ticket area to match the reference design (second screenshot) exactly.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT redesign the whole app. Only touch the order ticket component(s) and their CSS.
- Do NOT change trading engine logic except where needed to bind the UI correctly.
- Do NOT introduce placeholder prices or fake data. Bid/Ask must come from live quotes.
- Do NOT “approximate” the layout. Match the reference proportions and alignment.

SCOPE (only touch these):
- The order ticket component and its subcomponents
- Tailwind/CSS used by the ticket
- Any state hooks / props needed to bind bid/ask, lots, symbol, order type
- If needed: the quote selector hook that feeds the ticket

FILES:
First, identify the exact component file(s) currently rendering the ticket. List them in your response.
Then implement in-place changes, do not create a parallel new ticket that isn't used.

========================
TARGET UI (must match reference)
========================
We want the ticket to look like the second screenshot:
- Header row: Symbol dropdown + order type pill "MARKET" + toggles (SL, TP, TS) disabled/enabled chips + optional expand icon.
- Middle row: small informational row:
  - left: approx fee/value (like "$899.57" or your equivalent)
  - center: “Init. Margin: ~ $X (Y%)” (even if margin is fake for now, keep the structure; can show “Competition Mode” or “No margin”)
  - right: “0.01 lots” text (shows current lot step / min lot)
- Main execution row:
  [SELL big red price button] [ - ] [ lot input ] [ + ] [BUY big green price button]
- Buttons are horizontally aligned and share the same height.
- The lot input is centered, shows value like "0.01" or "0.10", with step increments.
- No huge empty spaces. No massive input box taking whole area. Dense terminal style.

Color & style:
- Dark ticket panel background (#0E141C / #101924)
- Hairline borders (#1C2533)
- BUY green: #16C784 (or current green)
- SELL red: Bullfight burnt red #D14B3A OR the red used across app (but it must be consistent)
- Price text is large (18–20px), label text is small (10–12px)
- Use tabular numbers for prices

========================
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
========================

A) Data binding
- Symbol dropdown controls which pair is being traded.
- Bid/Ask shown in SELL/BUY buttons must use live quote:
  SELL button shows BID
  BUY button shows ASK
- Spread display (if present) must be derived from bid/ask and pip rules.

B) Lot sizing (fix units vs lots confusion)
- The ticket input is LOTS (not units).
- Use step = 0.01 lots by default.
- Convert lots → units internally:
  units = lots * 100,000
- The payload sent to the engine must still use units, but UI displays lots.
- Show a small helper line under the lot input:
  "0.10 lots = 10,000 units"
- Clamp lots:
  minLots = 0.01
  maxLots = 100.00 (configurable)
- Add quick preset chips (optional) under sizing: 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.50, 1.00

C) Order type
- The order type selection exists as a pill button: MARKET (active)
- LIMIT/STOP may be present but disabled if not implemented.
- If LIMIT/STOP exists, it must not break the layout.

D) 1-click / confirm behavior
- Add a toggle "1-Click" in the ticket header.
- If 1-Click is OFF:
  clicking BUY/SELL opens confirm modal:
    symbol, side, lots, units, estimated fill price, spread, competition status
    confirm executes; cancel closes
- If 1-Click is ON:
  BUY/SELL executes immediately.
- Must show toast after submit: "Order sent" and after fill: "Filled @ price"

E) Disabled states
- If competition is not RUNNING:
  BUY/SELL buttons are disabled with tooltip "Competition not running"
  still show prices, but no execution
- If quote is stale:
  show "STALE" badge and disable execution until live

========================
LAYOUT SPEC (exact)
========================
Ticket panel layout (within right column):
- ticket padding: 12px
- header row height: ~32px
- info row height: ~22px
- execution row height: 56px (must match reference)
- All controls aligned to an 8px grid

Execution row specifics:
- SELL button: width 140–160px, height 56px, rounded 10px
  - price big
  - label "SELL" small below
- BUY button: same dimensions
- stepper buttons: 44px square, border, subtle background
- lot input: 84–100px wide, centered, border, dark background
- spacing between elements: 8px

Typography:
- Prices: font-semibold, 18–20px, tabular-nums
- Labels: 10–11px, uppercase, tracking wide, opacity 80%
- Info row: 11px muted

========================
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS (to avoid failure)
========================
1) Refactor ticket into these components:
- TicketHeader (symbol dropdown, MARKET pill, SL/TP/TS chips, 1-click toggle)
- TicketInfoRow (left/center/right small text)
- TicketExecutionRow (SELL button, stepper, input, BUY button)
- TicketHelpers (lots↔units line + optional preset chips)

2) State management:
- selectedPair (string)
- lots (number)
- oneClick (boolean in localStorage)
- orderType ("market" for now)
- slEnabled/tpEnabled/tsEnabled (booleans; can be present but disabled)
- derived units (number)

3) Input correctness:
- lots input must accept decimals, parse safely
- stepper buttons must increment/decrement by 0.01
- ensure formatting (2 decimals) for lots

4) Add a visual QA page or story:
- Add a dev-only route /dev/ticket that renders the ticket in isolation with mock quotes so we can verify layout quickly.
- Also render it in the real Arena.

========================
ACCEPTANCE TESTS (must pass)
========================
1) Ticket looks like the reference screenshot:
   - header row present
   - info row present
   - execution row with SELL / stepper / lot input / stepper / BUY present
   - no giant empty blocks
2) Bid/Ask update live and are shown in SELL/BUY.
3) Lots input works:
   - type 0.10, plus increments to 0.11, minus decrements to 0.09
   - helper line shows correct units
4) With competition RUNNING:
   - 1-click OFF → confirm modal appears → confirm executes
   - 1-click ON → executes immediately
5) With competition NOT RUNNING or stale quotes:
   - buttons disabled and tooltips shown

DELIVERABLE:
- Commit the UI refactor and ensure Arena still loads.
- Provide a short summary of what was changed and which files were edited.
